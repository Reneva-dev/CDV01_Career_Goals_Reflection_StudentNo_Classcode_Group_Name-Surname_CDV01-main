    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

       <p>Current Role/Position: Grade 4 Homeroom Educator</p>
       <p>Field of Interest: Web Development</p>

    <h2>Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection</h2>
         <p>1. Skills Analysis</p>
         <p>-Assessing my current skill set, I would identify communication and strong work ethic as viable strengths I possess. 
        My current expertise largely focuses on effective lesson planning and curriculum development. I am also proficient in leveraging technology
        to create engaging and interactive learning experiences for students and educators alike.</p>
        <p>-Areas that are in need of development would be time-management and delegation of tasks so I am able to effectively manage a team and 
        distrubute my time equally between tasks of varying urgency.</p>

       <p>2. Interests and Values</p>
          <p>-Key interests in my current career is developing resources using technology such as incorporating AI in lessons to research key topics
        and utilising various online tools to create professional development opportunities for educators.</p>
          <p>-Values such as tolerance and adaptability are vital in an environment that I am part of. I have worked in diverse workplaces and 
        expressing sensitive tolerance has enabled valuable connections. Integrity is another value that I hold in high regard as it is important that
        those who I work with can trust my word and actions.</p>

       <h2>Part 2: Career Exploration Insights</h2>
          <p>1. In 2024, I decided to enroll in an Instructional Design short course. Analysing the UDL model and how gamification is directly linked 
            to engagement unearthed a curiosity in me. It helped me reflect on my own teaching methods and how I could improve them.</p>
          <p>2.This curiosity piqued my interest in coding specifically accessibility. The world becomes limited to those who abled differently but
            through coding, I can create experiences that are inclusive for a larger audience.</p>
